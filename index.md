### Project Details: 
Increasing turbulence in the Airlines Industry and a competitive landscape are pushing all operators to rethink customer strategies. A key enabler is the data available on customers. Travelers nowadays are increasingly turning to social media, primarily Twitter and Facebook, to express their travel experience. This project aims to understand consumer sentiments on Social Media and to develop models that can accurately predict the response based on the available data. It also includes a strategy to translate model predictions into a set of actions needs to be put in place to improve customer satisfaction.

## [Multi-Class Text Classification](https://github.com/Priyakr14/Multi-Class-Text-Classification.git)

<img src="https://github.com/Priyakr14/Multi-Class-Text-Classification/blob/main/text_classification.png?raw=true"/>

### Project Details: 
Unstructured text data is everywhere on internet in the form of emails, chats, social media posts, complaint logs, and survey. Text classification is the process of categorizing text into different predefined classes. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content. Lately, deep learning approaches are achieving better results compared to previous machine learning algorithms on tasks like image classification, natural language processing, face recognition, etc. This study would cover supervised learning models and deep learning models for multi-class text classification and would investigate which methods are best suited to solve it. The classifier assumes that each new complaint is assigned to one and only one category..

### Project Details: 
Most Big names in technology industry, such as Disney, YouTube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, use recommender systems to enhance the viewer’s experience and increase profit. From e-commerce (suggest to buyer articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), they are on every online platform today. This project aims to develop a simple recommendation system based on MovieLens Dataset, to suggest users which movies to watch next.

## [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Priyakr14/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git)

<img src="https://github.com/Priyakr14/Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/master/customer%20churn.png?raw=true"/>

### Project Details: 
Most telecom companies suffer from voluntary churn. Churn rate has strong impact on the life time value of the customer because it affects the length of service and the future revenue of the company. Telecom companies have used two approaches to address churn - (a) Untargeted approach and (b) Targeted approach. The untargeted approach relies on superior product and mass advertising to increase brand loyalty and thus retain customers. The targeted approach relies on identifying customers who are likely to churn, and  provide suitable individuals incentives to stay, leading to improved retention and higher returns for every dollar spent on customer acquisition. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn or not churn.

## [Delivery System Optimization](https://github.com/Priyakr14/Optimization-of-Truck-Drone-Delivery-System.git)

<img src="https://github.com/Priyakr14/Optimization-of-Truck-Drone-Delivery-System/blob/master/Workhorse-Drone-Delivery-Truck-System%20(1).jpg?raw=true"/>

### Project Details: 
The problem under consideration is a Vehicle Routing problem. Industry is experiencing surge in variety of delivery services due to availability of items and fulfilment over the internet. A prevalent model is to utilize a delivery truck with one or more unmanned vehicles, drones in this case to achieve the delivery purpose with trucks simultaneously. In this study my objective is to minimize the total travel cost incurred at the same time by completing the task in the shortest time possible, hence selecting a minimum distance(optimal) route to cover all the customers.

## [AirBnB Zillow Property Analysis](https://github.com/Priyakr14/AirBnB-Zillow-Data-Analysis.git)

<img src="https://github.com/Priyakr14/AirBnB-Zillow-Data-Analysis/blob/main/airbnb-1.jpg?raw=true"/>

### Project Details: 
The problem under consideration involves a real estate company that has a niche in purchasing properties. It has planned to rent out short-term as part of their business model specifically within New York City, wants to know which zip codes are the best to invest in. The company has already concluded that two bedroom properties are the most profitable. Airbnb is a internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals. It allows you to, for example, rent (list) out your home for a week while you’re away, or rent out your empty bedroom. One challenge that Airbnb face is determine the optimal locations to buy properties. Zillow allows to view the property rates for various locations by their zipcodes. The data behind the Airbnb and Zillow site is sourced from publicly available information from the their sites.
